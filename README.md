Frontend for an API-powered Bookmarks application that lets the user store and rate their custom web bookmarks. Implemented jQuery for AJAX and DOM manipulation, namespacing to adhere to acceptable architecture standards, semantic HTML, and responsive design. Followed the React-ful design pattern of changing state and re-rerendering components and a11y best practices.

User Stories

As a user:

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title
url link
description
rating (1-5)
I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
I can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated above the chosen selection

I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
