feat: Improve accessibility and semantic HTML

This commit introduces several improvements to the application's accessibility and semantic HTML structure.

Key changes include:
- Enhanced interactive elements with appropriate ARIA attributes for better screen reader support.
- Improved form semantics, including `type="button"` for cancel buttons and `required` attributes for input fields.
- Replaced generic `div` elements with more semantic `section` and `article` tags where appropriate.
- Added a `visually-hidden` class for screen reader-only text.
- Updated heading structure in `index.html` for better document outline.
- Ensured `aria-expanded` attributes are correctly managed for dynamic content.
